# Quick React Projects

This is a collection of basic React apps that I made following tutorials and guides. The goal is to build something with React and get better at it. The projects can be made within a short period of time, hence the word "quick" in the title. 

**The apps aren't an exact copy. I've changed them as much as I can. Please check the respective project repo to find out the changes.**
